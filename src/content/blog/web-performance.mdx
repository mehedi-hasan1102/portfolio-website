## Understanding Web Performance

Web performance is critical for user experience and SEO. A slow website frustrates users and loses conversions.

## Core Web Vitals

Google's Core Web Vitals measure user experience:

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Measures when the largest content element becomes visible
- Target: Less than 2.5 seconds

### First Input Delay (FID)
- Measures responsiveness to user input
- Target: Less than 100 milliseconds

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Measures visual stability
- Target: Less than 0.1

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### 1. Image Optimization
```html
<!-- Use modern formats -->
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
</picture>
```

### 2. Code Splitting
Load JavaScript only when needed:
```javascript
const Component = lazy(() => import('./Component'));
```

### 3. Caching Strategies
- Browser caching
- CDN caching
- Service Workers

### 4. Minimize Third-Party Scripts
- Load tracking scripts asynchronously
- Use facade patterns for embedded content

## Monitoring Performance

Use tools to measure performance:
- **Lighthouse**: Built into Chrome DevTools
- **WebPageTest**: Detailed performance analysis
- **New Relic**: Real-time monitoring
- **Google Analytics**: User experience metrics
